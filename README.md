# VoiceAssistant
In my free time, I created this voice assistant for fun! ðŸ˜Š </br>
I called it Phantom IDK why but here is what Phantom can do: </br>
Phantom can create backend files like .php files by just saying the file name you want to create like Index.</br>
It can play any song by saying play [song name] and it will play it on youtube.</br>
It can google something by just saying google [anything].</br>
It can grab information about anything by saying: About [anything].</br>
those are the main features phantom do ðŸ˜ƒ</br>
----------------------------</br>
Q. How to use it?
A: 
- Run the app and say Play [song-name] e.g. Play Hello by Adele </br>
- Say google [anything] e.g. Google shops near me </br>
- Say about [anything] e.g. About Steve Jobs </br>
- Say create [file-name] e.g. Create connection </br>
